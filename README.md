#Scala Rudimentary Interpreter
###Zachry Jacklin

##About
rinterp is a simple rudimentary interpreter that takes strings representing expressions and parses them into a expression data structure. Those data structures can then be used to calculate the expressions into their given output integer.

##Language
This rudimentary interpreter was coded using Scala.

##How to run

###Java
Included is a .jar file called rinterp.jar which you can call using java to run the output in the out folder.

```bash
java -jar rinterp/out/artifacts/rinterp_jar/rinterp.jar
```

###Scala
You can run the program using scala on a terminal or command line if you have it set up.

Compile
```bash
scalac rinterp
```

Run
```bash
scala rinterp
```

###IDE
I created this program using Intellij as an IDE, so you can run the program on Intellij which can also run sbt.

##Source Code
The rest of the code is included in the src folder which you can look at.
